## iOS QuickStart Guide
---

You can find quick start on installing and using Syncano's iOS library (for both Obj-C and Swift) in our [documentation](http://docs.syncano.com/v4.0/docs/ios).

For more detailed information on how to use Syncano and its features - our [Developer Manual](http://docs.syncano.com/v4.0/docs/getting-stared-with-syncano) should be very helpful.

In case you need help working with the library - email us at libraries@syncano.com - we will be happy to help!

## Documentation
-------------

 Appledoc documentation can be generated by building a `Documentation` target in `syncano-ios.xcworkspace`. Docs will be in the `Syncano-Docs` directory and will be installed to the Xcode documentation, too. In case something is wrong, logs are put into the `appledoc.log` file. If you need to download `appledoc` visit [https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/).

To write documentation, we recommend using the [`VVDocumenter` XCode plugin](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode). It makes writing correctly structured documentation a little easier. Simply place your cursor above method/class/anything you wish to describe, and type `///` to generate a documentation template snippet for that item.
